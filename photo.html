		<p>This project is about the recent divide between science and the humanities in schools. My program is meant to make a comment about how the two can't be combined because society says they can't be combine. The rotating book of poems on a classroom floor is supposed to look glitchy with the multiple filters, the error message when the photo is clicked symbolizes the public view of the combination of science and the humanities, and the swapped functions for the buttons at the button (the play button pauses, the pause button plays, the forward button goes backwards, and the backwards button goes forward) are supposed to seem glitchy as well. I hope to achieve a realization about the way society extremely separates both literature and the humanities, with coding and science.</p>
